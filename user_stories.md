### As a marketing research team: ###

* As a marketing research team, I want to have an app that displays the picture of 3 different potential products at a time and allows the focus group participant to vote on their favorite by clicking on the image.

* As a marketing research team, I want the products to show up at the same time, side by side.

* As a marketing research team, I want to store the voting data.

* As a marketing research team, I want to have a report on the popularity of each product we are showing to the focus group participants.

* As a marketing research team, I want to keep the voting data hidden from the participants until at least 15 clicks have been made.

* As a marketing research team, I don't want the voting data to automatically display after 15 clicks, but for the participants to have the option to view the data after 15 clicks.

* As a marketing research team, I want to be able to collect data from more than one session from test participants.

###  As a developer:###

* As a developer, I want to build the JavaScript using good object oriented principals.

* As a developer, I want to write the code in modular form for readability and maintainability.

* As a developer, I want ensure all products get shown at least once before I display the results.

* As a developer, I want to build a page that is pleasant to look at, so I will develop a custom color palette, font, and layout using semantic HTML, (aka as few <div> tags as possible).

* As a developer, I want to supply the focus group participants with instructions on how to take part in the research.

* As a developer, I want write scripts to display 3 random images of potential products for the participants to vote on.

* As a developer, I want to make sure all the product images are of similar size and aspect ratio, to eliminate that variable from the marketing research.

* As a developer, I want the marketing data displayed to update if the user clicks on the display button again.

### As a focus group participant: ###
